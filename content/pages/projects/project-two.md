This project took everything from learning welding, metal-working, and the physics behind turning combustion into kinetic force. In this project I used a universal turbo for a car engine, this was used as my accelerator to generate kinetic energy and catapult the thermal energy out through the hot side of the turbo. The combustion chamber consisted of a carbon steel tube with holes that were sized to be the correct percentages of the area to feed the correct flow of oxygen to the flame as it travels. The housing goes around it, and a spark plug and gas rail come in the back to fill the chamber with the gas and ignite it. The Oil system was another huge challenge. I could not figure out a way to pump the oil from the reservoir into the system without messing up the flow rate or overheating the system. I ended up using a scavenger pump and hooking it up to a power supply, the reservoir fed the right flow out into the pump and into the turbo with a pressure release valve off of it to minimize risky parameters. This pipe allowed the oil if too high temp/pressure, to flow freely back into the reservoir and calm the system down. I am proud that the oil ended up working and it taught me a lot about flow rate and pressure. Overall, this project was intense, but very worth the advanced skills I learned. I am only more hungry to continue my pursuit of making faster engines and more efficent combustion.
